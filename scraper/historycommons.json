Lieutenant Colonel William Franklin Smith Jr. is piloting the B-25 Mitchell bomber on a routine personnel transport mission from Boston to LaGuardia Airport. He asks for clearance to land, but is advised of zero visibility. Proceeding anyway, he is disoriented by fog and starts turning right instead of left after passing the Chrysler Building. At 9:40 a.m., the plane crashes into the north side of the Empire State Building, between the 78th and 80th floors, carving an 18-foot hole in the building where the offices of the National Catholic Welfare Council are located. One engine shoots through the side opposite the impact. It flies as far as the next block where it lands on the roof of a nearby building and starts a fire that destroys a penthouse. The other engine and part of the landing gear plummet down an elevator shaft. The resulting fire is extinguished in 40 minutes. It is the only fire at such a height that is ever successfully controlled. Fourteen people are killed in the incident and one person is injured. Despite the damage and loss of life, the building opens for business on many floors the following Monday. The crash helps spur the passage of the long-pending Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946, allowing people to sue the government for the accident. <cite>[<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92987873\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Joe Richman, \u201cThe day a bomber hit the Empire State Building,\u201d &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;National Public Radio&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, 28 July 2008.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">National Public Radio, 7/28/2008</a>]</cite> </p>", "tags": ["William Franklin Smith Jr.", "Empire State Building", "Other Pre-9/11 Events"], "citations": ["<cite>[<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92987873\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Joe Richman, \u201cThe day a bomber hit the Empire State Building,\u201d &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;National Public Radio&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, 28 July 2008.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">National Public Radio, 7/28/2008</a>]</cite>"], "images": ["<span class=\"tmlnImg\" style=\"float:left;width:50px\"><img src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823im_/http://cdn.historycommons.org/images/events/empirestate200_2050081722-39745.jpg\" alt=\"Crash by a US Army B-25 bomber on July 28, 1945.\" width=\"50\"><span class=\"caption\">Crash by a US Army B-25 bomber on July 28, 1945. <em>[Source: NPR]</em></span></span>"], "url": "http://historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a45empirestate#a45empirestate", "id": "a45empirestate", "tz": "EDT", "source": "History Commons", "format": "html", "full_title": "July 28, 1945: Empire State Building Is Struck by a US Army B-25 Bomber - History Commons", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823im_/http://cdn.historycommons.org/images/events/empirestate200_2050081722-39745.jpg", "image_caption": "Crash by a US Army B-25 bomber on July 28, 1945.

He is currently taking a course in nuclear weapons deployment. Toward the end of the semester, he is given the assignment of imagining he is a Soviet premier who wants to start World War III against the US. Hill and his fellow trainees are told to prepare a written plan, describing how they would initiate the war. <br><u>Plan Involves Crashing Plane into Capitol Building</u> - Hill comes up with a plan, which he gives the code name \u201cState of the Union.\u201d It involves recruiting and training a suicide pilot, obtaining a C-47 transport plane, and filling it with explosives. Then, as journalist and author James B. Stewart will describe: \u201cOn the night of the State of the Union, the pilot would fly the plane straight into the Capitol building, through the rotunda, and into the House of Representatives, where the bombs on the plane would be set to explode. He\u2019d take out the president, his cabinet, the members of the Supreme Court, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and most senators and representatives. At that moment, the Soviet Union would unleash its nuclear missiles.\u201d According to Hill, everyone in the US would be \u201cwatching TV, there\u2019s no air defense around the Capitol; by the time anyone realized an aircraft was near, it would be too late.\u201d <br><u>Commander Questions Hill about His Plan</u> - On the Monday after Hill submits his plan, a lieutenant colonel in intelligence stops him on his way to class and says, \u201cI\u2019ve got some people who would like to talk to you.\u201d Hill is taken to a room where Major General John Carley, the assistant commander of the infantry school, is waiting, along with six men in uniform and several other men who are dressed in dark suits, all of them looking serious. Carley is holding Hill\u2019s paper and asks, \u201cHow did you come up with this?\u201d Hill replies, \u201cThis is my area of expertise,\u201d and explains that he has been trained in unconventional warfare, counterterrorism, the use of explosives, and demolition. He is then questioned for almost an hour about his plan. Finally, Carley says, \u201cWe\u2019d prefer you forget you ever did this.\u201d Hill agrees to do so and is then dismissed. <br><u>Hill Informs Friend about His Plan</u> - Hill writes to his friend Rick Rescorla, who has also served in the Army, about the incident. In his reply, Rescorla writes: \u201cYou evil-minded b_stard! When you have these thoughts, don\u2019t publicize them to anyone. The plan is tactically and technically proficient; it makes sense, but only to people like you and me. To the rest of the world, it looks like the workings of a deviant mind.

The hijackers are members of a group called the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) who want to gain the release of Palestinian militants held in Europe and Israel. <br><u>Hijackers Carry Hidden Weapons onto the Planes</u> - The series of events begins on September 6, 1970, when the PFLP members board three commercial aircraft at various European airports: Swissair Flight 100 from Zurich, TWA Flight 74 from Frankfurt, and El Al Flight 219 from Amsterdam. All three planes are bound for New York. The terrorists are able to carry concealed guns and grenades onto them. <br><u>Pilot Manages to Prevent One Hijacking</u> - The pilot of one of the planes, Flight 219, is alerted to four suspicious passengers\u2014actually the PFLP members\u2014before he takes off and has two of them removed from the plane. However, the other suspicious passengers, Leila Khaled and Patrick Arguello, are allowed to stay on board. Once the plane is airborne, they go to the front of it carrying hand grenades and demand to be let into the cockpit. But, to prevent the hijacking, the pilot puts the plane into a steep dive, thereby throwing the two terrorists off their feet. Arguello is shot dead by an air marshal in the ensuing struggle while Khaled is disarmed and held captive. The plane makes an emergency landing at Heathrow Airport, near London, and Khaled is then arrested by British authorities. <br><u>Two Hijacked Planes Land in Jordan</u> - Flight 100 and Flight 74, unlike Flight 219, are easily hijacked and, on the instruction of the hijackers, head to Jordan. They land at Dawson\u2019s Field, a disused airstrip in the desert. Dozens of PFLP members are waiting there to assist the hijackers. The planes\u2019 passengers are held at the airstrip for days. The terrorists demand the release of PFLP prisoners in Israel and Europe, and threaten to kill the hostages if their demands are refused. Meanwhile, reporters and television cameramen assemble around the airstrip, and the events taking place there are broadcast to the world. <br><u>Fourth Plane Is Flown to Egypt and Blown Up</u> - Remarkably, one of the PFLP members forced to get off Flight 219 in Amsterdam is able to get on another plane bound for New York, Pan Am Flight 93, with a hand grenade hidden in his groin area. He hijacks the flight once it is airborne and asks to be flown to Dawson\u2019s Field. The pilot tells him the plane is too large to land there and so he instead flies to Cairo, Egypt. <cite>[<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823/https://jewishjournal.com/culture/arts/12711/\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Tom Tugend, \u201cThe day a new terrorism was born,\u201d &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Jewish Journal&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, 23 February 2006.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Jewish Journal, 2/23/2006</a>; <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114073495672981829\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Dorothy Rabinowitz, \u201cThe dawn of terror,\u201d &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Wall Street Journal&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, 24 February 2006.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Wall Street Journal, 2/24/2006</a>; <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/hijacked/\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;PBS&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, \u201cHijacked!\u201d, 27 February 2006.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">PBS, 2/27/2006</a>; <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823/https://www.jpost.com/Features/In-Thespotlight/This-Week-in-History-Black-September-erupts-in-Jordan\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Michael Omer-Man, \u201cThis week in history: Black September erupts in Jordan,\u201d &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Jerusalem Post&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, 16 September 2011.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Jerusalem Post, 9/16/2011</a>; <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823/https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/rearvision/how-hijackings-and-bombings-have-shaped-the-way-we-fly/7762486\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Keri Phillips, \u201cHow hijackings and bombings have shaped the way we fly,\u201d &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Australian Broadcasting Corporation&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, 19 August 2016.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 8/19/2016</a>]</cite> On the way, the plane stops in Beirut, Lebanon, where it is laced with explosives. <cite>[<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823/https://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/hearings/hearing2/witness_schiavo.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('9/11 Commission, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Statement of Mary Schiavo to the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, May 23, 2003&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">9/11 Commission, 5/23/2003\u00a0<img src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823im_/http://www.historycommons.org/pics/icons/pdfbw.png\" alt=\"pdf file\"></a>]</cite> After it lands in Cairo, the passengers are able to get off just before it blows up. <br><u>Fifth Plane Is Hijacked and Flown to Jordan</u> - On September 9, PFLP sympathizers hijack another plane, BOAC Flight 775 bound from Bombay, India, to Beirut.

The psychologist is \u201ca serious student of global terrorist activity,\u201d according to historian and author David Clay Large. For his analysis, he examines the activities of the most ruthless terrorist groups, such as the Irish Republican Army (IRA), the Palestine Liberation Organization, the West German Baader-Meinhof gang, and the Basque separatist group ETA. He comes up with 26 worst-case scenarios, which he outlines in minute detail. Most of the scenarios focus on the Olympic Village where athletes will stay during the games. They include bombings by the IRA and ETA, and kidnappings by the Italian Mafia and the Uruguayan terrorist group Tupamaros. Notably, one of the scenarios involves a 9/11-style event in which Swedish neo-fascists hire a jet aircraft and deliberately crash it into the packed Olympic Stadium in a suicide attack. The organizers, however, are unhappy with Sieber\u2019s predictions. Manfred Schreiber, the Munich police chief, thinks they are too far-fetched and unrealistic. Sieber is asked to come up with some scenarios that are less frightening and that the organizers will consider more likely to occur. One of his imagined catastrophes, however, turns out to be eerily prescient.

The hijackers are then connected to the White House. John Ehrlichman, the president\u2019s top domestic aide, comes on the radio and Jackson tells him, \u201cI\u2019m up over Oak Ridge, where I\u2019ll either throw a grenade or I\u2019ll put this plane down nose first.\u201d He says he and the other hijackers want a letter signed by the president stating that their ransom money is a grant from the government and they won\u2019t be prosecuted. Ehrlichman says it will take some time to fulfil their request. <br><u>Hijackers Receive the Ransom Money</u> - The hijackers then direct the plane to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where it lands at 1:30 p.m. It is refueled and the hijackers are given the ransom money, along with food and other supplies. Southern Airways has only been able to put together $2 million, but the airline is assuming\u2014correctly, as it turns out\u2014that the hijackers will lack the time to count the money and realize it is much less than the amount they demanded. The plane leaves Chattanooga at 2:35 p.m. and heads to Cuba, where many hijackers fled during the 1960s and early 1970s. <br><u>Authorities Fear the Plane May Be Crashed into the President's Winter Home</u> - As Flight 49 is flying south over Florida, authorities become concerned that the hijackers might crash it into the president\u2019s retreat in Key Biscayne, where Nixon is currently staying. Military officials contact Florida\u2019s Homestead Air Reserve Base and fighter jets there are placed on alert as a precaution. Fortunately, no incident occurs and Flight 49 lands in Havana at 4:49 p.m. However, to the surprise of the hijackers, the Cubans are unhappy about the plane\u2019s arrival and soldiers surround the aircraft after it touches down. Jos\u00e9 Abrantes, President Fidel Castro\u2019s head of security, explains to the hijackers the nation\u2019s discomfort about the situation. Therefore, after being refueled, Flight 49 leaves Havana and heads back to the US. <br><u>FBI Agents Shoot the Plane's Tires</u> - It lands at McCoy Air Force Base in Orlando at 9:17 p.m. By now, Robert Gebhardt, assistant director of the FBI\u2019s investigative division, has given the order to disable the plane when it is next on the ground. Consequently, after it lands, FBI agents start shooting at its tires. The hijackers, realizing what is happening, order Haas to start the plane\u2019s engines. In the panic that follows, Jackson threatens Harold Johnson, the co-pilot, and shoots him in the arm in front of the terrified passengers. The hijackers give the order to take off and, despite now having two flat tires, the plane is able to get off the ground. Jackson then orders Haas to fly to Cuba again. The damaged plane makes an emergency landing in Havana at 12:32 a.m. on November 12. <cite>[<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823/https://eu.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2016/06/06/detroit-skyjacker-airplane-explanation/85314438/\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Detroit Free Press&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, \u201cHijacking: Minute by minute,\u201d 12 November 1972.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Detroit Free Press, 11/12/1972</a>; <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823/https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316068616/centerforcoop-20/\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Garrett M.

{"title": "1973-2002: Saudi Billions Lay Groundwork for Radical Militancy", "content": "<p>In 1973, the price of oil skyrockets, bringing a huge amount of wealth to Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich Middle Eastern countries. The Center for Security Policy (CSP), a Washington think tank, will calculate in 2003 that, between 1975 and 2002, the Saudi government spends over $70 billion on international aid. More than two thirds of the money goes to Islamic related purposes such as building mosques and religious schools. This money usually supports Wahhabism, a fundamentalist version of Islam dominant in Saudi Arabia but far less popular in most other Islamic nations. CSP scholar Alex Alexiev calls this \u201cthe largest worldwide propaganda campaign ever mounted\u201d in the history of the world. In addition, private Saudi citizens donate many billions more for Wahhabi projects overseas through private charities. Some of the biggest charities, such as the Muslim World League and its affiliate, the International Islamic Relief Organization (IIRO), are headed by Saudi government officials and closely tied to the government. The IIRO takes credit for funding 575 new mosques in Indonesia alone. Most of this money is spent on benign purposes with charitable intentions. But US News and World Report will assert in 2003: \u201cAccompanying the money, invariably, was a blizzard of Wahhabist literature.\u2026 Critics argue that Wahhabism\u2019s more extreme preachings\u2014mistrust of infidels, branding of rival sects as apostates, and emphasis on violent jihad\u2014laid the groundwork for terrorist groups around the world.\u201d <cite>[<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/031215/15terror.htm\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('David E.

He has with him a revolver and a bomb, which he made using gasoline housed in motor oil bottles and a crude igniter switch. At the airport, without warning, he pulls out the revolver and shoots dead a security guard. He then leaps over the security check and gets onto Delta Air Lines Flight 523 to Atlanta, Georgia, a DC-9, choosing this plane because it is the nearest flight that is ready to take off. <br><u>Man Shoots the Pilots and Threatens to Blow Up the Plane</u> - On the plane, Byck orders the pilots to take off immediately. They say they are unable to take off until the wheel blocks have been removed. Frustrated by the delay, Byck shoots the pilots, fatally wounding one of them. In his desperation, he then grabs a passenger and orders her to \u201cfly the plane.\u201d He also threatens to blow up the plane unless a flight attendant closes the door. After a standoff between Byck and the police ensues, a police officer starts firing through the cabin door, and two of his shots hit and wound Byck. Then, as the authorities close in, Byck commits suicide by shooting himself in the head. A briefcase containing the gasoline bomb is subsequently found under his body. <br><u>Incident 'Resonates' in American Minds after 9/11</u> - Following this incident, a bunker will be built deep inside the White House and large guns will be placed on the roof of the White House. A report published by the Federal Aviation Administration in 1987 will note that while Byck \u201clacked the skill and self-control to reach his target, he had provided a chilling reminder of the potential of violence against civil aviation.\u201d After the attempted assassination occurs, Byck\u2019s plot to kill Nixon will remain little known except within the US Secret Service. But it will again be mentioned in reports after 9/11. Then, one journalist will remark that \u201cthe terrifying memory of Samuel Byck\u2019s misguided scheme resonates in every American\u2019s mind whenever the thought of 9/11 visits our nightmares.\u201d And LA Weekly will comment, \u201cIn the evolution of terrorism, the use of American commercial airliners as murder weapons was \u2018pioneered\u2019 by\u2026 Byck.\u201d <cite>[<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823/https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=msu.31293022406882\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Edmund Preston, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Troubled passage: The Federal Aviation Administration during the Nixon-Ford term, 1973-1977&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; (Washington, DC: Federal Aviation Administration, 1987)., 52-53.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Edmund Preston, 1987, pp. 52-53</a>; <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823/http://www.laweekly.com/news/the-man-in-the-santa-claus-suit-2133809\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Matthew C.

Several of the founding members are leading members of the Muslim Brotherhood, including the \u201cBlind Sheikh,\u201d  Sheikh Omar Abdul-Rahman. The growth of Islamic banking directly funds the political growth of the Islamist movement and allows the Saudis to pressure poorer Islamic nations, like Egypt, to shift their policies to the right. The Islamic banking boom is closely associated with the neoliberal free-trade philosophy of the Chicago School of Economics, with the free-trade prescriptions of the International Monetary Fund, and with conservative think-tanks like the Virginia-based Islamic Free Market Institute. FIBE is also closely associated with the infamous Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), which will be found to be deeply implicated in the illegal arms and narcotics trades, and with the funding of terrorist organizations when it collapses in 1991. Investigators will also find that BCCI held $589 million in \u201cunrecorded deposits,\u201d $245 million of which were placed with FIBE. <cite>[<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805076522/centerforcoop-20\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Robert Dreyfuss, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Devil\\'s Game: How the United States Helped Unleash Fundamentalist Islam&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; (New York, NY: Metropolitan Books, 2005)., 164 - 175.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Dreyfuss, 2005, pp. 164 - 175</a>]</cite> </p>", "tags": ["Operation Bright Star", "Omar Abdul-Rahman", "Mohammed al-Faisal al-Saud", "Chicago School of Economics", "Bank of Credit and Commerce International", "Faisal Islamic Bank of Egypt", "Muslim Brotherhood", "Terrorism Financing", "BCCI"], "citations": ["<cite>[<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805076522/centerforcoop-20\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Robert Dreyfuss, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Devil\\'s Game: How the United States Helped Unleash Fundamentalist Islam&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; (New York, NY: Metropolitan Books, 2005)., 164 - 175.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Dreyfuss, 2005, pp. 164 - 175</a>]</cite>"], "images": [], "url": "http://historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=western_support_for_islamic_militancy_202707#western_support_for_islamic_militancy_202707", "id": "western_support_for_islamic_militancy_202707", "tz": "EDT", "source": "History Commons", "format": "html", "full_title": "1976: Faisal Islamic Bank of Egypt Founded, Funds Political Growth of Islamist Movement - History Commons", "image": "", "image_caption": null},

Pakistan owes large debts to international organizations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but lacks the money to pay off its loans.

With banks able to make more loans, the economy will be able to perform better. BCCI secretly loans the State Bank the hard currency until the 90 days are over and then takes it back.

Khomeini is enraged, and on November 4, just three days after the Algeria meeting begins, Khomeini arranges for students to take over the US embassy in Teheran and seize hostages. This realigns political forces in Iran and allows Khomeini to sideline Bazargan and other others meeting in Algeria, rendering the negotiations there moot.

Other training takes place at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Harvey Point, North Carolina, and Fort A. P. Hill, Virginia. Subjects are trained in how to detect explosives, surveillance, how to recruit new agents, how to run paramilitary operations, and more.

{"title": "Early 1980s: FBI Encounters Problems Passing Intelligence Information to Criminal Prosecutors, \u2018Wall\u2019 Arises", "content": "<p>Due to apparent problems with the use of intelligence information in criminal proceedings, a set of procedures that later becomes known as the \u201cwall\u201d begins to take shape. The FBI, which performs both criminal and counterintelligence functions, normally obtains two types of warrants: criminal warrants and warrants under the recently passed Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). FISA warrants are thought to be easier to obtain, as the FBI only has to show that there is probable cause to believe the subject is a foreign power or an agent of one. Sometimes a case begins as an intelligence investigation, but results in a criminal prosecution. In court the defense can then argue that the government has abused FISA and obtained evidence by improperly using the lower standard, so any evidence obtained under FISA should not be allowed in court. Although the government can use information it happens to obtain under a FISA warrant for a criminal prosecution, if the purpose of obtaining information under a FISA warrant is for a criminal prosecution, this is in violation of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against warrantless searches. To combat this apparent problem, the special FISA Court decides that for a warrant under FISA to be granted, collecting intelligence information must be the primary purpose, although such information can be used in a criminal investigation provided the criminal investigation does not become the primary purpose of the surveillance or search. As a result of these procedures, when the FBI is conducting an intelligence investigation and uncovers evidence of criminal activity, it no longer consults local United States Attorneys\u2019 Offices, but prosecutors within the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. The prosecutors then decide when the local attorney\u2019s office should become involved. <cite>[<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823/http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/special/s0606/final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('US Department of Justice, Office of Inspector General, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;A Review of the FBI\\'s Handling of Intelligence Information Related to the September 11 Attacks&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, 21-24.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">US Department of Justice, 11/2004, pp. 21-24\u00a0<img src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823im_/http://www.historycommons.org/pics/icons/pdfbw.png\" alt=\"pdf file\"></a>]</cite> The wall will be extended in the 1990s (see <a href=\"item.jsp?item=a071995wallmemo&amp;timeline=complete_911_timeline\" onmouseover=\"return OL('July 19, 1995: \u2019Wall\u2019 Memo Cuts Criminal Investigators Off from Intelligence Information')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">July 19, 1995</a>) and will be much criticized before and after 9/11 (see <a href=\"item.jsp?item=a0799wallcriticised&amp;timeline=complete_911_timeline\" onmouseover=\"return OL('July 1999: Campaign Finance Report Criticizes \u2018Wall\u2019 Procedures')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">July 1999</a> and <a href=\"item.jsp?item=a041304ashcrofttestifies&amp;timeline=complete_911_timeline\" onmouseover=\"return OL('April 13, 2004: Attorney General Ashcroft Blames \u2018Wall\u2019 for 9/11 Failures, but 9/11 Commission Believes He Is Exaggerating')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">April 13, 2004</a>). </p>", "tags": ["Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act", "Federal Bureau of Investigation", "US Department of Justice", "Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court", "Counterterrorism Policy/Politics"], "citations": ["<cite>[<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823/http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/special/s0606/final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('US Department of Justice, Office of Inspector General, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;A Review of the FBI\\'s Handling of Intelligence Information Related to the September 11 Attacks&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, 21-24.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">US Department of Justice, 11/2004, pp. 21-24\u00a0<img src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823im_/http://www.historycommons.org/pics/icons/pdfbw.png\" alt=\"pdf file\"></a>]</cite>"], "images": [], "url": "http://historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a80wallarises#a80wallarises", "id": "a80wallarises", "tz": "EDT", "source": "History Commons", "format": "html", "full_title": "Early 1980s: FBI Encounters Problems Passing Intelligence Information to Criminal Prosecutors, \u2018Wall\u2019 Arises - History Commons", "image": "", "image_caption": null},

Although not a fundamentalist Muslim, Berri allies himself with the new regime in Iran and Hezbollah, a fundamentalist Lebanese Shi\u2019a party backed by Iran. Berri also manages to convince Syrian authorities that he will represent their interests in Lebanon and comes to a similar arrangement with the Ba\u2019ath party in Iraq. This is a difficult balance for Berri to keep, as journalists Joe and Susan Trento will later point out, \u201cIf he displeased the Iranian mullahs who controlled the supply of money to Hezbollah in Lebanon, he would lose his grip on power.\u201d Former intelligence officer Michael Pilgrim will comment, \u201cBerri was targeted for CIA recruitment and so were members of his militia\u2026 I think it\u2019s safe to say we financed his early trips to Iran.\u201d He also commences relationships with the Drug Enforcement Agency and Defense Intelligence Agency. Unsurprisingly, some of the consequences of this are bad for the US, and the Trentos will comment: \u201cThe relationship would end in a series of deadly disasters for members of our armed services and the CIA. According to US intelligence officials who served in Lebanon at the time, Berri kept the peace with [Iran] and the Shi\u2019a by allowing them to attack Westerners in his Amal-controlled territory. To prove his loyalty to the Shi\u2019a and keep the alliance that was essential to his power base, he failed to pass on intelligence to the United States.\u201d Based on interviews with former intelligence officers and associates of Berri, the Trentos will conclude that he facilitated attacks on the US by Hezbollah by allowing their operatives to pass Amal checkpoints without warning the US, for example before attacks on the US embassy and Marine barracks in 1983 in which hundreds die (see <a href=\"#a041883beirutbombings\" onmouseover=\"return OL('April 18-October 23, 1983: Beirut Bombings Begin Era of Suicide Attacks')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">April 18-October 23, 1983</a>). <cite>[<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823/http://www.amazon.com/Unsafe-any-Altitude-Investigations-Scapegoating/dp/158642128X\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Joseph Trento and Susan Trento, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Unsafe at any altitude&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; (Hanover, NH: Steerforth, 2006)., 74-77.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Trento and Trento, 2006, pp. 74-77</a>]</cite> </p>", "tags": ["Nabih Berri", "Michael Pilgrim", "Drug Enforcement Administration", "Hezbollah", "Amal", "Defense Intelligence Agency", "Central Intelligence Agency", "US confrontation with Iran", "US Intel Links to Islamic Militancy"], "citations": ["<cite>[<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823/http://www.amazon.com/Unsafe-any-Altitude-Investigations-Scapegoating/dp/158642128X\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Joseph Trento and Susan Trento, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Unsafe at any altitude&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; (Hanover, NH: Steerforth, 2006)., 74-77.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Trento and Trento, 2006, pp. 74-77</a>]</cite>"], "images": ["<span class=\"tmlnImg\" style=\"float:left;width:115px\"><img src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823im_/http://cdn.historycommons.org/images/events/a808_nabih_berri_2050081722-20016.jpg\" alt=\"Nabih Berri in 1982.\" width=\"115\"><span class=\"caption\">Nabih Berri in 1982. <em>[Source: Reza / Corbis]</em></span></span>"], "url": "http://historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a0480berriamal#a0480berriamal", "id": "a0480berriamal", "tz": "EDT", "source": "History Commons", "format": "html", "full_title": "April 1980: New Leader of Lebanese Militia Forms Alliances with Hezbollah, US Agencies, and Others - History Commons", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823im_/http://cdn.historycommons.org/images/events/a808_nabih_berri_2050081722-20016.jpg", "image_caption": "Nabih Berri in 1982.

Ford Library]</em> (click image to enlarge)</span></span>Throughout the 1980s, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld are key players in one of the most highly classified programs of the Reagan administration. Presently, Cheney is working as a Republican congressman, while Rumsfeld is head of the pharmaceutical company G. D. Searle. At least once per year, they both leave their day jobs for periods of three or four days. They head to Andrews Air Force Base, near Washington, DC, and along with 40 to 60 federal officials and one member of the Reagan Cabinet are taken to a remote location within the US, such as an underground bunker. While they are gone, none of their work colleagues, or even their wives, knows where they are. They are participating in detailed planning exercises for keeping government running during and after a nuclear war with the Soviet Union. <br><u>Unconstitutional 'Continuity of Government'</u> - This highly secret \u201cContinuity of Government\u201d (COG) program is known as Project 908. The idea is that if the US were under a nuclear attack, three teams would be sent from Washington to separate locations around the US to prepare to take leadership of the country. If somehow one team was located and hit with a nuclear weapon, the second or third team could take its place. Each of the three teams includes representatives from the State Department, Defense Department, CIA, and various domestic-policy agencies. The program is run by a new government agency called the National Program Office. Based in the Washington area, it has a budget of hundreds of million dollars a year, which grows to $1 billion per year by the end of Reagan\u2019s first term in office. Within the National Security Council, the \u201caction officer\u201d involved in the COG program is Oliver North, who is a key figure in the mid-1980s Iran-Contra scandal. Reagan\u2019s Vice President, George H. W. Bush, also supervises some of the program\u2019s efforts. As well as Cheney and Rumsfeld, other known figures involved in the COG exercises include Kenneth Duberstein, who serves for a time as President Reagan\u2019s chief of staff, and future CIA Director James Woolsey. Another regular participant is Richard Clarke, who on 9/11 will be the White House chief of counterterrorism (see <a href=\"#a84clarkecog\" onmouseover=\"return OL('(1984-2004): Richard Clarke Participates in Secret Continuity of Government Exercises')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">(1984-2004)</a>). The program, though, is extraconstitutional, as it establishes a process for designating a new US president that is nowhere authorized in the US Constitution or federal law. After George H. W. Bush is elected president in 1988 and the effective end of the Soviet Union in 1989, the exercises continue. They will go on after Bill Clinton is elected president, but will then be based around the threat posed by terrorists, rather than the Soviet Union (see <a href=\"item.jsp?item=a92cogcontinues&amp;timeline=complete_911_timeline\" onmouseover=\"return OL('1992-2000: Secret Continuity of Government Exercises Prepare for Terrorist Threat')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">1992-2000</a>). According to journalist James Mann, the participation of Rumsfeld and Cheney in these exercises demonstrates a broader truth about them: \u201cOver three decades, from the Ford administration onward, even when they were out of the executive branch of government, they were never too far away; they stayed in touch with its defense, military, and intelligence officials and were regularly called upon by those officials. Cheney and Rumsfeld were, in a sense, a part of the permanent, though hidden, national security apparatus of the United States.\u201d <cite>[<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670032999/centerforcoop-20\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('James Mann, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Rise of the Vulcans: The history of Bush\\'s war cabinet&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; (New York: Penguin, 2004)., 138-145.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Mann, 2004, pp. 138-145</a>; <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823/https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2004/03/the-armageddon-plan/302902/\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('James Mann, \u201cThe Armageddon plan,\u201d &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Atlantic Monthly&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, March 2004.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Atlantic Monthly, 3/2004</a>; <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2004/04/07/armageddon-plan-was-put-into-action-on-911-clarke-says/fce9af72-54e6-43d3-a177-7d29dccfb50b/\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Howard Kurtz, \u201c\\'Armageddon\\' plan was put into action on 9/11, Clarke says,\u201d &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Washington Post&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, 7 April 2004.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Washington Post, 4/7/2004</a>; <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1416535748/centerforcoop-20/\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Andrew Cockburn, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Rumsfeld: His rise, fall, and catastrophic legacy&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; (New York: Scribner, 2007)., 85.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Cockburn, 2007, pp. 85</a>]</cite> <br><u>No Role for Congress</u> - According to one participant, \u201cOne of the awkward questions we faced was whether to reconstitute Congress after a nuclear attack.

{"title": "After June 16, 1982: Arrest of \u2018Rogue\u2019 Agent Leads US to Divert Blame for Terrorist Acts from Iran to Libya", "content": "<p>According to investigative journalists Joe and Susan Trento, the arrest of former CIA agent Edwin Wilson, who was involved in business dealings with Libya, has serious consequences for US terrorism policy: \u201cThroughout the 1980s the United States used its intelligence services to divert blame from Iran and Hezbollah onto Libya as part of its entanglement in Iran-Contra with the so-called moderate Iranians with whom the Reagan administration dealt. Ever since international arms dealer Edwin Wilson had been captured and imprisoned in the early 1980s, American intelligence and the White House had labeled Libya a rogue nation, and Libyan dictator Mu\u2019ammar al-Qadhafi a terrorist leader. The intelligence operation went so far that the United States actually recruited a gang of Lebanese criminals to pretend to be a cell of Libyan-backed terrorists conducting violent acts around the world.\u2026 These activities, all choreographed by the CIA, were fed to allies such as West Germany as authentic intelligence that implicated Libya for terrorists acts that were either fake or were, in reality, authorized by Iran and carried out by Hezbollah and other surrogate groups.\u201d <br><u>Benefit to Iran</u> - This policy apparently benefits Iran: \u201cThe Reagan administration had given the Iranians plenty of cards to play. The biggest card was the help it had provided making Libya seem like the ultimate source of all terrorist acts.\u2026 When the Reagan administration turned Libya into a vicious terrorist nation operating throughout Europe, that gave Iran the perfect opening for retribution.\u201d <br><u>No action against Hezbollah</u> - In addition, it prevents the US from taking action against Hezbollah, even though Hezbollah is killing Americans: \u201cBecause of the Iran-Contra scandal\u2014the selling of weapons to Iran to fund the war in Central America\u2014the Reagan administration ended up protecting Iran\u2019s number one terrorist proxy, Hezbollah, while at the same time Hezbollah\u2019s terrorists were killing and kidnapping hundreds of Americans. While secretly working with the Iranian government, the Reagan administration manipulated intelligence to blame Libya for terrorist attacks for which Hezbollah was responsible. During the 1980s Hezbollah killed and terrorized hundreds of Americans in Beirut, bombing the US Marine barracks, blowing up the CIA station, and killing State Department employees in a bomb attack on the US embassy. Hezbollah did all this with the help of local militia leaders whom the United States relied on as its secret conduits to Iran for its sale of weapons.\u201d <cite>[<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823/http://www.amazon.com/Unsafe-any-Altitude-Investigations-Scapegoating/dp/158642128X\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Joseph Trento and Susan Trento, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Unsafe at any altitude&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; (Hanover, NH: Steerforth, 2006)., xvi, 64-5.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Trento and Trento, 2006, pp. xvi, 64-5</a>]</cite> </p>", "tags": ["Joseph Trento", "Central Intelligence Agency", "Edwin Wilson", "Iran", "Susan Trento", "Hezbollah", "Mu\u2019ammar al-Qadhafi", "US confrontation with Iran", "Iran-Contra Affair", "Counterterrorism Policy/Politics"], "citations": ["<cite>[<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823/http://www.amazon.com/Unsafe-any-Altitude-Investigations-Scapegoating/dp/158642128X\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Joseph Trento and Susan Trento, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Unsafe at any altitude&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; (Hanover, NH: Steerforth, 2006)., xvi, 64-5.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Trento and Trento, 2006, pp. xvi, 64-5</a>]</cite>"], "images": [], "url": "http://historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=aafter061682wilsonarrestconsequences#aafter061682wilsonarrestconsequences", "id": "aafter061682wilsonarrestconsequences", "tz": "EDT", "source": "History Commons", "format": "html", "full_title": "After June 16, 1982: Arrest of \u2018Rogue\u2019 Agent Leads US to Divert Blame for Terrorist Acts from Iran to Libya - History Commons", "image": "", "image_caption": null},

Pakistan\u2019s military handles the flow of weapons from Karachi to the Afghan border, but once there the supplies have to be carried by mules to reach the mujaheddin fighting in remote Afghan mountain ranges. BCCI controls this part of the supply chain as well. Sometimes BCCI personnel simply transport the supplies across Afghanistan to Iran and then sell them there for a profit. <cite>[<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210911135823/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1587981467/centerforcoop-20\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Jonathan Beaty and S.

The CIA therefore works to spread the idea that the Libyans intend to plant another bomb in Berlin, a propaganda operation designed to reshape European public opinion. According to a CIA officer involved in the operation, the first step is \u201cto convince German intelligence and police there was a terrorist cell.\u201d To achieve this, a Lebanese CIA asset named Jamal Hamdan, who helps the US in various ways around this time, makes a series of phone calls from an apartment in Cyprus to suspected terrorists in Germany. Hamdan also tells a relative living in West Berlin that his brother Ali and a friend will enter the city carrying a package, which, it is implied, is a bomb. Ali Hamdan and the friend then enter West Berlin illegally from the east and are arrested by German police, who wrongly believe that they actually have a bomb and the plot is real. Word of the plot is leaked to the US press, enabling the Reagan administration to quell criticism of the attack on Libya. The CIA then steps in and has the two men held in Germany released. <cite>[<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210613233217/http://www.amazon.com/Unsafe-any-Altitude-Investigations-Scapegoating/dp/158642128X\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Joseph Trento and Susan Trento, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Unsafe at any altitude&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; (Hanover, NH: Steerforth, 2006)., 89-90.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Trento and Trento, 2006, pp. 89-90</a>]</cite> </p>", "tags": ["Libya", "Central Intelligence Agency", "Ali Hamdan", "Reagan administration", "Jamal Hamdan", "Alleged Use of False Flag Attacks", "Counterterrorism Action Before 9/11", "US Intel Links to Islamic Militancy"], "citations": ["<cite>[<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210613233217/http://www.amazon.com/Unsafe-any-Altitude-Investigations-Scapegoating/dp/158642128X\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Joseph Trento and Susan Trento, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Unsafe at any altitude&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; (Hanover, NH: Steerforth, 2006)., 89-90.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Trento and Trento, 2006, pp. 89-90</a>]</cite>"], "images": ["<span class=\"tmlnImg\" style=\"float:left;width:281px\"><img src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210613233217im_/http://cdn.historycommons.org/images/events/a814_la_bella_club_2050081722-20022.jpg\" alt=\"The La Belle disco in Berlin after it was bombed.\" width=\"281\"><span class=\"caption\">The La Belle disco in Berlin after it was bombed. <em>[Source: AFP]</em></span></span>"], "url": "http://historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=aaftermid0486fakebomb#aaftermid0486fakebomb", "id": "aaftermid0486fakebomb", "tz": "EDT", "source": "History Commons", "format": "html", "full_title": "After Mid-April 1986: CIA Allegedly Sets Up Fake Bomb Plot to Influence European Opinion - History Commons", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210613233217im_/http://cdn.historycommons.org/images/events/a814_la_bella_club_2050081722-20022.jpg", "image_caption": "The La Belle disco in Berlin after it was bombed.

The camp is near the village of Jaji, close to the Pakistani border in eastern Afghanistan. Previously, the Arabs had been integrated with local Afghan forces, although there have been problems with the language barrier and the Arabs\u2019 readiness for battle, which sometimes meant they were used as cannon fodder. A later account by author Lawrence Wright will say that Bin Laden sees the camp as the \u201cfirst step toward the creation of an Arab legion that could wage war anywhere.\u201d <br><u>The Camp</u> - The equipment at the camp includes a bulldozer, Kalashnikov machine guns, mortars, some small anti-aircraft guns, and Chinese rockets (although there are no rocket launchers for them). Most of the people at the camp are Egyptians associated with Ayman al-Zawahiri, or young Saudis. The camp is only three kilometers from a Soviet base, meaning there is a serious danger it could be attacked and fall. <br><u>Opposition from Azzam</u> - However, the camp is opposed by bin Laden\u2019s mentor, Abdullah Azzam, because he wants all the Muslims\u2014both Arabs and Afghans\u2014to work together, not a separate camp for Arabic speakers. In addition, Azzam thinks the camp is expensive and, given the guerrilla style of warfare in Afghanistan, impractical. <br><u>Construction Work</u> - Bin Laden soon brings in construction vehicles to make the camp more easily defensible. Using equipment from his family firm, he builds seven hidden man-made caverns overlooking an important supply route from Pakistan. Some of the caves are a hundred yards long and twenty feet high, and serve as shelters, dormitories, hospitals, and arms dumps. <cite>[<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210613233217/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/037541486X/centerforcoop-20\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Lawrence Wright, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;The looming tower: Al-Qaeda and the road to 9/11&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; (New York: Alfred A.

The CIA is already supporting other mujahedeen leaders by paying cash to the ISI, Pakistan\u2019s intelligence agency, which in turn gives money to the leaders. But Haqqani is a rare case of the CIA working with an Afghan leader without going through the ISI. But at the same time, the ISI also heavily supports and funds Haqqani. At this time, Osama bin Laden and other Arabs fighting in Afghanistan are based in territory controlled by Haqqani, so the CIA support for Haqqani also benefits bin Laden and other radical Islamists fighting with him. Bin Laden will later call Haqqani a \u201chero\u201d and \u201cone of the foremost leaders of the jihad against the Soviets.\u201d Coll will later write: \u201cHaqqani traveled frequently to Peshawar to meet with a Pakistani and, separately, with an American intelligence officer, and to pick up supplies.

His group has killed over 300 people. But in 1987 his attacks generally come to a halt.

For instance, the government of Kuwait deposits $80 million into Nidal\u2019s BCCI bank account in London in 1987. Kuwait will later deny the payments took place, but counterterrorism experts will dismiss the denials and say that such payments to Nidal were common.

Mohamed convinces el-Dahab to move to the US and become a sleeper cell agent. El-Dahab does so in 1987, moving to Santa Clara, California, where Mohamed has a residence. El-Dahab marries an American woman, becomes a US citizen, and gets a job at a computer company. In 1987, a female acquaintance of el-Dahab enters his apartment unannounced and finds several men there cleaning rifles. She decides it is something she does not want to know about, and breaks off contact with him. In 1990, Mohamed and el-Dahab travel together to Afghanistan. They are financially supported by a network of US sympathizers, including two Egyptian-American doctors. Beginning in 1990, El-Dahab\u2019s apartment becomes an important communications hub for al-Qaeda and Islamic Jihad cells all over the world. For much of the 1990\u2019s, the Egyptian government cut direct phone links to countries like Sudan, Yemen, Afghanistan or Pakistan in an effort to disrupt communications between radical militants. So Dahab acts as a telephone operator for the Islamic Jihad network, using a three-way calling feature to connect operatives in far-flung countries. He communicates with bin Laden\u2019s base in Sudan (where bin Laden lives until 1996). He receives phone calls from the likes of Islamic Jihad leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, who also visits California twice (see <a href=\"item.jsp?item=aspring93zawahirivisit&amp;timeline=complete_911_timeline\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Spring 1993: Islamic Jihad Head Fundraises in US')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Spring 1993</a>; <a href=\"item.jsp?item=alate94zawahirivisit&amp;timeline=complete_911_timeline\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Late 1994 or 1995: Islamic Jihad Head Fundraises in US Again')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Late 1994 or 1995</a>). He distributes forged documents and makes money transfers. He is trained to make booby-trapped letters, enrolls in a US flight school to learn how to fly gliders and helicopters, and recruits additional US sleeper agents (see <a href=\"item.jsp?item=amid90s10sleepers&amp;timeline=complete_911_timeline\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Mid-1990s: Ali Mohamed Associate Said to Recruit 10 Sleeper Agents in US')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Mid-1990s</a>). He helps translate US army manuals and topographical maps into Arabic for al-Qaeda and Islamic Jihad training. El-Dahab will move to Egypt in 1998 and get arrested in October of that year. He will confess his role in all of this in an Egyptian trial in 1999.

Following a quick strike, the Arabs will then withdraw, using the night to hide from Soviet aircraft. However, the logistics are badly handled: ammunition is not supplied to forward positions, the Arabs forget electrical wire to connect rockets to detonators, and they run out of food. In addition, an Afghan government soldier overhears their preparations and opens fire with a machine gun, pinning them down. The Arabs are forced to withdraw without even having begun their attack, suffering three casualties, including one killed.

As a result, he forces his men to retreat, although some of them protest and have to be cajoled into doing so. Before pulling out, the camp is destroyed so that the Soviets cannot use it; the canons are pushed into a ravine, the automatic weapons buried, and the pantry grenaded. <br><u>Ordered to Return</u> - Bin Laden\u2019s men fall back on a camp run by a leading Afghan commander, Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, one of the key mujahidden leaders in the area. However, Sayyaf has come to recognize the Lion\u2019s Den\u2019s strategic value, and is angry they pulled back without his approval. Sayyaf orders the Arabs back and sends about twenty of his own men to make sure they hold their position. <br><u>Attacked Again, Victorious</u> - After he returns, bin Laden, who has been ill, is too distraught at the camp\u2019s poor condition and lack of food to give orders, and one of his senior assistants, Abu Ubaidah al-Banshiri, takes over. Bin Laden is sent to guard one of the camp\u2019s flanks, but his small group of men encounters a Soviet advance and comes under heavy mortar fire.

His success in defeating Soviet air security is called \u201ca national shame\u201d by Mikhail Gorbachev, who promptly sacks a number of top military officers. <br><u>Entering Soviet Airspace</u> - According to a detailed recounting of Rust\u2019s flight in Air &amp; Space Magazine, his small Cessna is seen on Soviet radar as soon as he enters Soviet air space in what\u2014after the break-up of the Soviet Union\u2014is Estonia and, since he is not on a pre-approved flight, \u201cthree missile units were put on alert.\u201d Throughout his flight, Rust takes no special measures to evade radar and simply flies straight toward Moscow at about 1,000 feet above ground. As he flies deeper inland, Soviet controllers continue to monitor his progress; \u201carmy units [are] put on high alert and two fighter-interceptors [\u2026 are] scrambled to investigate.\u201d One of the interceptors reports seeing a small plane but takes no further action. It is unclear why Rust is not immediately forced to land or simply shot down. <br><u>More Fighters Scrambled</u> - About two hours later, as Rust enters another radar sector, the same sequence of events takes place: he is seen on radar, two fighters are scrambled. \u201cA Soviet MIG-23 pull[s] up beside him.\u201d Once again, for reasons that will not be established, the commander on the ground takes no further action: \u201cthe fighter pilot\u2019s commander either did not believe the pilot\u2019s report or did not think it was significant, so the information was never passed up the chain of command.\u201d As he continues to Moscow, Rust\u2019s plane is never lost to radar, but controllers fail to realize that he is an unauthorized foreign plane\u2014there are no such things in the Soviet Union\u2014and conclude that he must be a \u201cstudent\u201d or \u201ca helicopter on a search-and-rescue mission.\u201d <br><u>\"Ring of Steel\"</u> - Although Rust has turned off his transponder, air controllers decide to assign him a \u201cfriendly\u201d designation, assuming he is a Soviet pilot who has forgotten to turn it on. As he approaches Moscow, Rust \u201cpass[es] the outermost belt of Moscow\u2019s vaunted \u2018Ring of Steel,\u2019 an elaborate network of anti-aircraft defenses that since the 1950s had been built up as a response to the threat of US bombers. The rings of missile placements circle the city [\u2026] but were not designed to fend off a single, slow-flying Cessna.\u201d Finally, Rust reaches the outskirts of Moscow. The city\u2019s airspace is restricted, with all overflights prohibited. \u201cAt about this time, Soviet investigators would later tell Rust, radar controllers realize[\u2026] something [is] terribly wrong, but it [is] too late for them to act.\u201d <br><u>Mass Firings</u> - The Soviet leadership\u2019s reaction to the military\u2019s bungling will be swift. Within days, the defense minister and air defense chief will be sacked and later \u201chundreds of other officers [will be] fired or replaced [\u2026]. It will be the biggest turnover in the Soviet military command since Stalin\u2019s bloody purges of the 1930s.\u201d <cite>[<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210613233217/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D91738F934A35755C0A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Bill Keller, \u201cGORBACHEV SEIZES THE CHANCE TO RESTRUCTURE THE MILITARY,\u201d &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;New York Times&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, 7 June 1987.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">New York Times, 6/7/1987</a>; <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210613233217/http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/rust.html\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Tom LeCompte, \u201cThe Notorious Flight of Mathias Rust,\u201d &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Air &amp; Space Magazine&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, 1 June 2005.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Air &amp; Space Magazine, 6/1/2005</a>; <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210613233217/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/26/AR2007052601262_pf.html\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Peter Finn, \u201cA Dubious Diplomat: 20 Years Ago, a Young Pilot Took a Headlong Flight Into Cold War History,\u201d &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Washington Post&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, 27 May 2007.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Washington Post, 5/27/2007</a>]</cite> </p>", "tags": ["Mathias Rust", "Other Pre-9/11 Events"], "citations": ["<cite>[<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210613233217/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D91738F934A35755C0A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Bill Keller, \u201cGORBACHEV SEIZES THE CHANCE TO RESTRUCTURE THE MILITARY,\u201d &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;New York Times&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, 7 June 1987.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">New York Times, 6/7/1987</a>; <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210613233217/http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/rust.html\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Tom LeCompte, \u201cThe Notorious Flight of Mathias Rust,\u201d &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Air &amp; Space Magazine&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, 1 June 2005.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Air &amp; Space Magazine, 6/1/2005</a>; <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210613233217/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/26/AR2007052601262_pf.html\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Peter Finn, \u201cA Dubious Diplomat: 20 Years Ago, a Young Pilot Took a Headlong Flight Into Cold War History,\u201d &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Washington Post&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, 27 May 2007.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Washington Post, 5/27/2007</a>]</cite>"], "images": ["<span class=\"tmlnImg\" style=\"float:left;width:109px\"><img src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210613233217im_/http://cdn.historycommons.org/images/events/33_2050081722-24825.jpeg\" alt=\"Mathias Rust Landing in Moscow.\" width=\"109\"><span class=\"caption\">Mathias Rust Landing in Moscow. <em>[Source: sssss]</em></span></span>"], "url": "http://historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a052887rust#a052887rust", "id": "a052887rust", "tz": "EDT", "source": "History Commons", "format": "html", "full_title": "May 28, 1987: Teenager Eludes Soviet Air Defenses, Lands on Red Square; Many Russian Officers Fired for Failings - History Commons", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210613233217im_/http://cdn.historycommons.org/images/events/33_2050081722-24825.jpeg", "image_caption": "Mathias Rust Landing in Moscow.

In the second hijacking, which took place five days later, the plane was seized by a team from Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah, who beat the passengers and shot one of them, US Navy diver Robert Stethem.

From the very beginning, there are signs that Holy Land is supports illegal violent acts committed by Hamas. For instance, In 1990, Haitham Maghawri will apply for asylum in the US. He will tell the INS that he had been arrested several times in Lebanon, once for placing a car bomb. He will be denied asylum, but will gain permanent residence by marrying a US citizen. He then will become executive director of Holy Land. Additionally, government documents, corporate records, and Arabic-language articles show clear connections between Hamas, Holy Land, and a closely related group, the Islamic Association for Palestine (IAP). For instance, in the late 1980s, Mousa Abu Marzouk, a known political leader of Hamas living in the US, is the chairman of IAP\u2019s advisory committee and donates hundreds of thousands of dollars to the IAP. The IAP publicly recommends Muslims should donate money to Holy Land to support Hamas in the Palestinian <i>intifada</i> (uprising) against Israel.

Hamas was formed in 1987, after a Palestinian uprising began the year before. Some claim that Israel indirectly supported and perhaps even directly funded Hamas in its early years in order to divide the Palestinians politically. For instance, a former senior CIA official will later claim that Israel\u2019s support for Hamas \u201cwas a direct attempt to divide and dilute support for a strong, secular PLO [Palestinian Liberation Organization] by using a competing religious alternative.\u201d Hamas begins attacks on Israeli military and civilan targets in 1989 and will begin suicide attacks on these targets in April 1994. The US will not officially declare Hamas a terrorist organization until 1995 (see <a href=\"item.jsp?item=a0195hamasillegal&amp;timeline=complete_911_timeline\" onmouseover=\"return OL('January 1995: US Officially Declares Hamas a Terrorist Organization')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">January 1995</a>).

Working on the orders of high-level Hamas leader Mousa Abu Marzouk, Salah leads a four day Hamas training camp in the Chicago area in June 1990. According to one trainee, the approximately twenty-five trainees study Hamas philosophy, receive weapons training, and learn how to plant a car bomb. Two of the trainees are ultimately selected to fly to Syria, where they undergo more advanced training in making car bombs and throwing grenades. Ultimately, they are sent into Israel to launch attacks. Similar training camps take place in Kansas City and Wisconsin from 1989 through early 1991. Then, Salah is told by Marzouk to change his focus from training to fundraising. In early 1992, Salah receives about $800,000 from Saudi multimillionaire Yassin al-Qadi, and he temporarily invests it in a BMI real estate scheme (see <a href=\"item.jsp?item=a91qlimoney&amp;timeline=complete_911_timeline\" onmouseover=\"return OL('1991: Portion of Saudi Multimillionaire\u2019s BMI Investment Pays for Hamas Attacks')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">1991</a>). Between June 1991 and December 1992, Salah repeatedly travels to the Middle East and spends more than $100,000 in direct support of Hamas military activities. He attempts to spend the $800,000 that is still invested in BMI, but BMI is unable to quickly liquidate the investment. Marzouk sends Salah almost $1 million to spend. Salah goes to the West Bank in January 1993 and begins dispersing that money, but he is arrested before the end of the month. With Salah arrested, Hamas needs a new point man to collect and transfer new money raised in the US. Jamil Sarsour, a grocery store owner in Milwaukee, is chosen. It will be reported in 2003 that Sarsour is still living openly in Milwaukee (see <a href=\"item.jsp?item=a060203hamasopen&amp;timeline=complete_911_timeline\" onmouseover=\"return OL('June 2-5, 2003: Suspected Hamas Operatives Living Openly in US')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">June 2-5, 2003</a>) <cite>[<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210613233217/http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/southflorida/sns-worldtrade-kadi-ct,0,7109422.story\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('David Jackson, Laurie Cohen, and Robert Manor, \u201cFinancier Denies Sending Funds to bin Laden,\u201d &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Chicago Tribune&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, 29 October 2001.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Chicago Tribune, 10/29/2001</a>; <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210613233217/http://web.archive.org/web/20021212143645/http://www.laweekly.com/ink/02/37/news-crogan.php\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Jim Crogan, \u201cAnother FBI Agent Blows the Whistle,\u201d &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;LA Weekly&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, 2 August 2002.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">LA Weekly, 8/2/2002</a>; <a class=\"nL\" onmouseover=\"return OL('&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Federal News Service&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, \u201cFBI Special Agent Robert Wright Holds News Conference On Justice Department And FBI Failings In War On Terror,\u201d 2 June 2003.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Federal News Service, 6/2/2003</a>]</cite> </p>", "tags": ["Mousa Abu Marzouk", "Central Intelligence Agency", "Jamil Sarsour", "Yassin al-Qadi", "Mohammad Salah", "Hamas", "BMI Inc.", "Robert Wright and Vulgar Betrayal", "Terrorism Financing"], "citations": ["<cite>[<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210613233217/http://www.upi.com/inc/view.php?StoryID=18062002-051845-8272r\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Richard Sale, \u201cAnalysis: Hamas History Tied to Israel,\u201d &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;United Press International&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, 18 June 2002.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">United Press International, 6/18/2002</a>; <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210613233217/http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2004-03-22-hamas-timeline_x.htm\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Associated Press&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, \u201cMain Events in Hamas\\' History,\u201d 22 March 2004.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Associated Press, 3/22/2004</a>]</cite>", "<cite>[<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210613233217/http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/southflorida/sns-worldtrade-kadi-ct,0,7109422.story\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('David Jackson, Laurie Cohen, and Robert Manor, \u201cFinancier Denies Sending Funds to bin Laden,\u201d &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Chicago Tribune&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, 29 October 2001.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Chicago Tribune, 10/29/2001</a>; <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210613233217/http://web.archive.org/web/20021212143645/http://www.laweekly.com/ink/02/37/news-crogan.php\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"return OL('Jim Crogan, \u201cAnother FBI Agent Blows the Whistle,\u201d &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;LA Weekly&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, 2 August 2002.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">LA Weekly, 8/2/2002</a>; <a class=\"nL\" onmouseover=\"return OL('&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Federal News Service&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, \u201cFBI Special Agent Robert Wright Holds News Conference On Justice Department And FBI Failings In War On Terror,\u201d 2 June 2003.')\" onmouseout=\"return nd()\">Federal News Service, 6/2/2003</a>]</cite>"], "images": ["<span class=\"tmlnImg\" style=\"float:left;width:134px\"><img src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210613233217im_/http://cdn.historycommons.org/images/events/556_hamas_logo.jpg\" alt=\"\nHamas logo.\n\" width=\"134\"><span class=\"caption\">\nHamas logo.\n <em>[Source: Hamas]</em></span></span>"], "url": "http://historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a89hamascamps#a89hamascamps", "id": "a89hamascamps", "tz": "EDT", "source": "History Commons", "format": "html", "full_title": "1989-January 1993: Hamas Trains and Fundraises in US - History Commons", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210613233217im_/http://cdn.historycommons.org/images/events/556_hamas_logo.jpg", "image_caption": "\nHamas logo.\n "},

The radicals are secretly monitored as they shoot AK-47 assault rifles, semiautomatic handguns, and revolvers for four successive weekends. The use of weapons such as AK-47\u2019s is illegal in the US, but this shooting range is known to be unusually permissive. Ali Mohamed is apparently not at the range but has been training the five men there: El Sayyid Nosair, Mahmud Abouhalima, Mohammed Salameh, Nidal Ayyad, and Clement Rodney Hampton-El.

Some FBI agents have been assigned to watch some Middle Eastern men who are frequenting the Al-Kifah Refugee Center in Brooklyn. Each weekend, Mohamed\u2019s trainees drive from Al-Kifah to the shooting range and a small FBI surveillance team follows them. The FBI has been given a tip that some Palestinians at Al-Kifah are planning violence targeting Atlantic City casinos. By August, the casino plot will have failed to materialize and the surveillance, including that at the shooting range, will have come to an end.
