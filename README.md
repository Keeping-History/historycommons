## PROJECT DISCLAIMERS
This project does not validate or censor items from the archive copy of History Commoons. Merely, we serve as a way to preserve and present this data. When you are consuming this data, scrutiny and source research are essential. No contributors to this project are responsible for the content provided. In rare circumstances, and at the sole disretion of the project owner or any delegated persons, content may be edited or removed only after attempts to reach and mitigate the content with the original author are exhausted. While there is defined no criteria for removal of content, a complaintant must provide trusted, sourced documentation before project members will modify any content.

While the original historycommons.org provided for editing and commenting on items, our site currently does not. While we do want to provide the ability for trusted users to add and modify items, we will not allow comments or allow regular users to add or edit items. We encourage open discourse, just not here. Please do not add comments about editing or removing content to our github repository.

### Discussions
Discussions are welcome here: https://github.com/robbiebyrd/historycommons/discussions/categories
PLEASE NOTE: We will maintain very strict standards for moderation of our discussions. Please see below for valid areas of discussion. Messages deemed defamatory, harassing, abusive or intentionally insensitive will be removed.

As much as we'd like to have a very open and un-moderated discussion, given the topic we know this is impossible. Thank you for adhering to our areas of discussion.
